# runes 

A collection of utility packages for easier unicode handling.

## Usage

The blocks are split into packages so you don't have to import all of Unicode to use some of the runes.

## Generate

Run `generate.sh` to re-generate the files.

# WORK IN PROGRESS

This is just a first version, no tags so far, might change/break in the future.

# License

The generator code is released under CC0, so no attribution is needed. Please see [Unicode licensing](http://www.unicode.org/copyright.html) for general usage of Unicode.
